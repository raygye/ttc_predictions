# ttc_predictions
http://ttc.raygye.ga

Using NextBus API and Google Maps Javascript API, the site retrieves and 
displays the arrival time predictions of buses and streetcars of the 
TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) in Toronto, Ontario. 

ETA predictions update every 5 seconds, but the map refreshes every 30
seconds to accommodate the irregularity of vehicle GPS updates.

Predictions can be selected either by route or by stop number, accepted 
through their respective menus.

If there is a "This page can't load  Google Maps correctly." pop-up 
as well as the "For developmental purposes only" overlay, the project is 
no longer on my Google billing plan.
